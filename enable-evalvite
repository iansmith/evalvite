# this file should be _SOURCED_ into your shell, not executed. it does not
# a she-bang (#!) for a reason.
#
# you will need to go into the `tools` directory and adjust the symlinks to
# select the version of node, npm, and other tools you want. the `tools`
# directory will be the place where all tools are found (not /usr/local/bin
# or similar "global" directory).  If you want to use the version in your
# /usr/local/bin or similar, just make the symlink in tools point to it.
#
# it sets up all the PATH and other vars you need for doing development
# on this package (evalvite).
#
# it is meant to be sourced _ONLY_ when your current directory is the
# directory that contains this script.
#
# this approach has been validated by 30-40 years of experience.  you want
# to know _exactly_ what your are running in terms of tools and versions. this
# approach is at least one order of magnitude simpler than things like node version
# manager (nvm) or similar.
#

# this path is _deliberately_ small. this is for the shell in which you do development
# tasks like `npm run` or similar.  This value should _NEVER_ contain constructions
# like export PATH=${PATH}:/blah/blah because that makes this script non-idempotent
# and you want to be sure that you can source this script and it will _do the
# right thing_.
export PATH=${PWD}/tools:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Library/Apple/usr/bin

echo development for evalvite is set to
echo -n npm:
npm --version
echo -n node:
node --version
